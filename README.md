**Software Engineer | PhD**

Iâ€™m a **Software Engineer** with a PhD in Engineering & IT, and I love turning big ideas into realâ€‘world solutions. Whether itâ€™s crafting pixelâ€‘perfect UIs, architecting reliable backâ€‘ends, or automating rockâ€‘solid deployments, Iâ€™m all about clean code, thoughtful design, and getting things done.

## ðŸš€ What I Do

- **Backâ€‘end Development:** Node.js, Ruby on Rails
- **Frontâ€‘end Magic:** Svelte, React, TypeScript, WebAssembly
- **DevOps & Deployment:** Docker, AWS, CI/CD with Buildkite / GitHub Actions  
- **Quality & Testing:** Vitest, Playwright

My PhD research dove deep into MRI engineeringâ€”electromagnetic simulations, pulse design, and data analysis. I built Pythonâ€‘powered imageâ€‘processing pipelines that went straight into production, helping bridge the gap between research and realâ€‘world impact.

## âœ¨ Featured Project

**[MR.VELOUS](https://mrvelous.app/)**  
A Progressive Web App for medical image viewing, built with TypeScript and WebAssembly. Itâ€™s fast, efficient, and backed by a modern CI/CD pipeline.

## ðŸŽ¨ Beyond Code
I bring diverse engineering experience from CAD design to industrial control and optical measurement systems, plus I'm into 3D printingâ€”it keeps my problem-solving skills sharp and creativity flowing.

I'm excited about opportunities that allow me to blend my engineering expertise with my love for programming and web development. Whether it's enhancing user interfaces, building complex simulations, or contributing to impactful digital projects, I'm eager to jump in and make a difference.

Let's build something amazing together!
